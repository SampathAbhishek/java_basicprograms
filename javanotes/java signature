what exactly is a java virtual machine?
Java virtual machine (JVM) provides a virtual environment for interpreting the byte code generated by the compiler.

So let us understand this.

When we run a java file it is basically executed in 2 steps.
step 1:-
compiler executes the java code and generates a byte code which is a file with .class extension.
step 2:-
JVM interprets this byte code and generates a  machine code according to the real machine.
So byte code is independent of platform.
Write a java program once generate a byte code ,and you can basically run it across any platform.


what is public static void main(String args[]) ?

public:-
since the jvm calls the main function which is basically the starting point in the program.It actually call's it from outside so in order to not get restricted we are using 
an access modifier public so anyone from outside the class could call it.
Static:-
It is essential to keep the function static,otherwise we should create an object to access it.
void:-
It doesn't return anything
String args[] -> syntax.

System.out.println()

System is defined inside java.lang package.
out is an object defined under System
like this
public static final PrintStream out;
inside PrintStream class println() method is defined publicly.
so to access it we need to use out.pritnln()
but out is defined inside System as a static field member.So in order to access this class variable we definitely need to use System.out
so hence combining two we have System.out.println()
